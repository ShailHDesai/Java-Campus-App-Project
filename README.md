# Campus Bus App

Welcome to the **Campus Bus App**, a Java Spring Boot-based application designed to provide real-time bus tracking and schedule management for university campuses. This project integrates **Spring Boot**, **Oracle SQL**, and a **Load Balancer** for optimized, scalable performance, ensuring reliable service for users.

# Overview

The Campus Bus App allows users to check real-time bus locations, estimated arrival times, and route information, offering students and faculty a convenient way to plan their campus commute. The application features a robust backend, built using **Java Spring Boot**, which communicates with an **Oracle SQL** database to fetch and store schedule information, user preferences, and bus tracking data.

The project is also expanding to support mobile platforms, with both **Android Studio** and **iOS apps** currently in development by our dedicated **Mobile Development Team**.

# Key Features

- **Real-time Bus Tracking**: Users can view live bus locations, routes, and schedules.
- **Bus Stop Information**: Provides detailed information about each bus stop on the campus routes.
- **Optimized Performance**: Load balancer integration to manage traffic and ensure the app runs smoothly during peak usage times.
- **Cross-Platform Mobile Support**: Android app under development, with an iOS version on the way.

# Tech Stack

## Backend

- **Java**: The core language for the backend, offering a highly scalable and robust application.
- **Spring Boot**: Provides the framework for developing the RESTful API and handling backend services efficiently.
- **Oracle SQL**: Manages all data storage, including user preferences, bus schedules, and live tracking information.

## Load Balancer

- Implements a **load balancing** mechanism to distribute traffic evenly across server instances, improving application availability and scalability.

## Frontend & Mobile Development

- **Android App**: Currently in development using **Android Studio**, designed for seamless interaction with the backend.
- **iOS App**: Our Mobile Development Team is working on an **iOS version**, soon to be released.

# Current Development

- **Backend**: Fully functional, with RESTful APIs exposed for bus schedules and tracking.
- **Android**: App development is in progress, targeting key features for campus navigation.
- **iOS**: The mobile development team is actively working on the iOS version, which will be released soon.
